The files in this directory are as follows:
 - Basic_LMS.m - Implmentation of the basic LMS algorithm and its analysis for different step sizes
 - Basic_NLMS.m - Implmentation of the basic NLMS algorithm and its analysis for different step sizes
 - Filtered_X_LMS.m - Implmentation of the filtered-X LMS algorithm and its analysis for different step sizes
 - Filtered_X_NLMS.m - Implmentation of the filtered-X NLMS algorithm and its analysis for different step sizes
 - filtered signal.wav - Output from realnoise.m which is the signal after noise cancellation on noisysignal.wav
 - filtered signal1.wav - Output from realnoise.m which is the signal after noise cancellation on noisysignal1.wav
 - anc.wav - Voice sample used for testing the active noise cancellation in realnoise.m 
 - moonlight_sonata_bethoven.wav - Audio sample used for testing the active noise cancellation in realnoise.m (Generated from synthesizer done in lab 5)
 - noisysignal.wav - The noisy signal in realnoise.m before it is filtered (moonlight_sonata_bethoven.wav with noise)
 - noisysignal1.wav - The noisy signal in realnoise.m before it is filtered (anc.wav with noise)
 - realnoise.m - Use of NLMS to remove noise from a noisy signal which consists of an audio clip along with randomly generated noise
